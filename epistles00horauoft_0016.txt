12 INTRODUCTION.

dramatic performances are said to have originated in songs
relating the adventures of the wine-god Dionysus or Bacchus ;
these were sung by a chorus of fifty men dancing round the
altar of the god. From these rude beginnings Thespis,
Aeschylus and Sophocles (all mentioned by Horace) succes-
sively developed tragedy at Athens 3 Thespis introduced
(3.0. 535) an actor to speak independently of the chorus,
Aeschylus adding a second actor and Sophocles a third.
Though the drama was still regarded as especially connected
with the worship of Bacchus, the subject of the edes and
dialogues was no longer confined to that god's adventures,
but the plots were drawn from the whole range of mytho-
logy and history.

Greek comedy grew up contemporaneously with tragedy.
In Sicily Epicharmus began about B.C. 480 to write plays
which seem to have been mainly burlesques of the ancient
mythological stories, plenlifully intermixed with moral
maxims. At Athens we find the ‘⁴ Old Comedy '' becoming,
in the hands of Cratinus, who exhibited his first play in
Bc. 454, a means of attacking political and moral offenders.
AristophaneS, the best-known writer of the Old Comedy,
lived long enough to see its freedom in this respect re—
stricted; from 404 to 338 is the period assigned to the
“Middle Comedy,'' which caricatnred the manners of the
time, and from which the chorus entirely disappeared.
This was succeeded by the “ New Oomedy'' <Mo—260), of
which the greatest ornament was Menander, a poet highly
skilled in the delineation of character.

Of the origin of Roman comedy Horace himself gives ns
an account (Ep. Π. i. 139—155); subsequently nearly all
dramatic performances at Rome consisted of imitations or
adaptations of Greek plays. The first writer who intro-
duced pieces of this description was Livius Androniffls
(13.0. 240), who composed both tragedies and comedies, as
also did Naevius (235), Pacuvius (b. 219, d. 130), Ennius,
and Accius (b. 170). Five dramatists mentioned by Horace
devoted themselves to conicdy alone: Plautus, Caecilius,
Terence, Afranius, and Atta, the period covered by their
works being from B.c. 225 to Rc. 80; their models were
mainly the writers of the Ncw Comedy. Sometimes they
