g 6. Metre. The metre of the Epistles is the Dactylic
Hexameter, in which each verse consists of six feet, and
each foot is a dactyl (-*‘*‘), or its equivalent, a spondeo
(- -). To this rule the last (sixth) foot is an exception,
admitting only of two syllables, of which the last is either
long or short.

The fifth foot is regularly a dactyl, but a spondes
occasionally occurs.

The following are regular Hexameter lines (1. i. l,
and I. ii. 65) :—
(ω) 1)ιῖωᾶ Ι ᾱῖοιέωἴ- 1 hl, n sfim- ι ms] ‹ii- ι agad} es:- Ι ωζωι.

(b) Ire vi Ι um qu} Ι monstret ΙΙ e· Ι ques; ve· Ι naticus, Ι ex quo.

In each verse should occur a caesura (= “ cutting ’')—
that is, a pause in the sound, due to the ending of one
word and the commencement of the next in the middle of
a metrical foot. When occuring‚ as it usually does, at the
end of the first syllable of the third foot (as in line a
above), the caesura is known as stronq or male. When
oceurring at the end. of the second syllable in a dactylic-
third foot (as in line b), it is known as weak orsemale.

Sometimes the caesura is found in the fourth foot3 eff.
I. ii. 46 :—

- υυ - — -- - υυ - uu —

(ο) Quod satis Ι est cui Ι contin· Ι git nihil Ι amplius Ι optet.

Rumon—Before a word beginning with a vowel or Ιι
a final vowel or diphthong is elided, as also is a final m
together with the vowel preceding it; ey. I. i. 3 :—

-υυ ...

- - ,. , - - 0 υ -
(cl) Maece· Ι nas, ite· Ι rum anti· Ι quoume in· Ι eludere Ι ludo.

ξ 7. Prosody. A syllable contains either one vowel or
a diphthong; any syllable containing a diphthong or long
vowel is a long syllable, and a syllable containing a short
vowel is a short syllable unless two eonsonants (see Rule
3, below) follow the vowel.
