The Trojan War, of which Homer told the story in his I l iad, arose
from the carrying off the Laeedemonian king Menelaus' peerless
wife Helen by Paris, son of Priam the king of Troy. The two sons
of Atreus, Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae,
visited all the ehieftains of Greeee, and persuaded them to join in an
expedition to avenge the wrong, and bring back Helen. Agamemnon
was chosen commander-in-chief‚ and among the most celebrated os
the Greek heroes were Achilles, the son of Peleus; Nestor, king of
Pylos; and Ulysses‚ ‘³ of the many wiles‚” the king of Ithaca, whose
subsequent wanderings Homer narrates in the Odys-vegs. When they
arrived in the Troad an embassy was sent to Troy to demand the
surrender of Helen, and Antenor, one of the wisest eidem of Troy,
urged the Trojans to eomply ; but they listened rather to Paris and
made up their minds to fight. For nine years the Greeks could do
nothing against the losty walls and towers of Troy, defended by the
brave Trojans and their heroic leader, Hector. In the tenth year
Agamemnon enraged Achilles by taking from him a fair captive
named Briseis. Achilles withdrew from the conflict with his men.
and thus the Trojans were emboldened to press hard upon the Greeks.
At last Achilles came to the rescae, slew Hector, and drove the
Trojans back within their walls. He himself subsequently fell while
attempting to force his way into the town, but Troy was at last
captured by Ulysses' stratagem of the Wooden Herse. and was then
utterly destroyed. After the fall of Troy, Ulysses set out on his
voyage home, but was driven out of his course by storms ; and for
many years wandered from land to land, visiting among oth« r places
the isle of Aeaea, where lived Circe the sorceress. llere all his
comredes but one were turned into swine, but he sucveeded in
rescuing them at last. Later on he passed without har-111 the isle os
the Sir-ens, and visited the earthly paradise where Alcinous was king.
After many more adventures he came home to Ithaca. Hire he
found his faithful wife Penelope beset by many wooers, whose
importunity she had year after year resisted.
