and Terence, were based on the Ncw Greek Comedy, survive (Af. 44).

Cascellius, -ii, m, : Aulus, an eminent lawyer, who belonged to the
age of Cicero and Caesar. References to him, other than that in
Horace, speak rather of his daring eloquence and boldness than his
knowledge of law (A.P. 371).

all luxuries, and used his position as censor, 184 B.c.‚ to disgrace many
men of high rank. He was also famous for his hatred of Carthage,
and just before his death instigated the Third Punic War. He was
also the first writer of Latin prose, and composed a treatise called the
Oriyines on the history of Latin. A manual on agriculture de
Re Rustica, is the only one of his works extant (ΙΙ. ii. 117, Ay. 56).

D.

Democritus, -i, m.: (460-361 Bc.) born at Abdera in Thrace,
Democritus spent his patrimony in extensive travels which he under-
took to increase his knowledge, He became one of the most learned
philosophers of Greece, and was one of the founders of the atomio
theory which is worked out by Lucretius in his De Rerum Natura.
His disposition was very amiable, but his chcerful way of looking at
the circumstances of life was intcrprcted by later writers as meaning
that he laughed at the follies of mankind. The saying that no one
could b(— a great poet without a touch of madness was commonly
attributed to him (Ι. xii. 123 ΙΙ, i. 194; Al). 297).
