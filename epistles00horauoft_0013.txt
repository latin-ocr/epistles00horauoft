that it was not contemporaneous with the Fourth Book of
the odes, but was written either between Bc 20 and nc. 17
or at some date after 13,c. 13. The date of the Ars Poetica,
(sometimes called the Third Epistle of the Second Book,
or the Epistle to the Pisos), is equally uncertain: till
recent years it was looked upon as unfiuished3 editors

Note on the Date of the Epe'stles. The evidence for the
date of the Epistles is wholly internal. 'sliat of Ep. Ι. iii.
is Bc. 20, when Julius Florus was in the suit of Tiberius
during his stay in Armenia. Ep. I. xviii. and I. xii. alludo
to the restoration, in Bc. 20, of the standai-ds captui-od by
the Parthians from Crassus and Antonius. ‚ln Ι. xii.
Horace alludes to the conquest of the Cantabrians by
Agrippa in B.c. 20-19, and at the end of Book Ι. statos
that he was foi-ty-four years of age in the December of tlw
year marked by the consulship of Lepidus and Lollius.
Lollius was consul 13.c. 21. From thos(¹ indicatione-1 it may
be inferred that tho First Book was written between uc. 2³3
and Β 0. 20. The date of Book ΙΙ. is doubtful, but Epistlos
Π. i. belongs to the closing years of IIoruco's lis‹·, und
may be about six years luter than the l·lpistle to Florus.
