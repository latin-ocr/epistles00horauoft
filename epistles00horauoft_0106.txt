102 HORACE, EPISTLES, BOOK 1. [xvm.

41. gratia: “good-will,⁷' “friendship.'' Amphionis atque Zethi:
Amphion and Zethus were the twin sons of Jupiter and Antiope of
Thebes. Amphion was skilled in playing the lyre. After a quarrel
as to the use of music with Zethus, the shepherd, he yielded to his
sterner brother’s wishes and ceased to play.

42. suspecta : “regarded with suspicion,'' as tending to effeminacy.
severo: sest-atri. The dative denotes the agent.

46. †Aeoliis: said to refer to fine but strong nets made of fiax
from the neighbourhood of Cumae, a colony from the Aeolian town
of Cyme. A more widely accepted reading is Aetolis, an epithet
used to recall the famous bear-hunt of Meleager in Calydon, an
ancient town of Aetolia.

48. pariter ; sc. cum patrono tm».

49. sollemne: (sollus, “whole,” annus, “year'’) “what occurs
once in a whole year,” “annual,'’ “customary'' opus: best ex-
plained as accusative in apposition, not to any particular word, but
to the whole preceding clause, as far as it refers to hunting. This
construction is eommoner in Greek than in Latin.

53. tractet: consecutive subjunctive. quo clamore: ablative of
attendant circumstance. coronae ε not infrequently = “the ring of
s ectators.''
p54. campestria z in the Campus Martius.

55. cantabrica bella z the campaign against the Cantabrians directed
by Augustus in person ΒΩ. 25.

56. templis Parthorum signa refigit: ‘·' is taking down the standards
from the rai-thian temples.'’ The standards which had been taken
from Crassus at Carrhae, B.O. 53, by the Parthians were restored by
Phrahates B.C. 20.

58. ne z for ne introducing the negative purpose, not of the action
mentioned, but of the mentioning of it, see Ι. i. 13, π.

59. quamvis here takes the indicative, as often in Horace. extra
numerum . . . modumque: “ out of time and tunc,” im. beyond the
bounds of propriety. fecisse : ‘⁴ to prove to have done.” See I. xvii.
5, n. The perfect infinitive is seldom used as the direct object, except
after a few verbs like ἰ-υἰο.

60. rure paterno: this form of the locative, and not ruri, is used
when an attribute accompanies the word.

61. Aetia pugna: the battle of Actium, in Acarnania, ended in the
total defeat of Antony and Cleopatra by Augustus ΒΩ. 31.

62. pueros : the slaves of the wealthy patron.

64. velox : Victoria (the Greek Nike) was represented in works of
art with wings; hence this epithet. coronet: this is a final sub-
junctive; but donee, in v. 42, is followed by the indicative as de·
noting a relation merely tcmporal.

66. utroque . . . laudabit pollice: the exact nature of the gesture
referred to is unknown. It was customary in the amphitheatre for
the audience to signify their wish that a fallen gladiator should be
allowed to live by turning their thumbs down wards. Horace probably
refers to this.
