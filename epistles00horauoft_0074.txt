possessed prophetie power, but only gave his answers when caught
and bound. To avoid capture he had the power of changing into all
sorts of forms.

91. quid pauper: sc.saeit? cenacula: ‘⁴ gari-ets.”

92. conducto navigio : ablative absolute, equivalent to a concessive
sentence, “though he has to pay hire for the boat.''

94. inaequali tonsore : this cannot be ablative of the agent, which
always requires a, αῖ); it is an ablative absolute, “when the barber
has cut unevenly,'' so ⁴‘ by a barber’s uneven cutting.’' capillos:
retained accusative. See v. 50, n.

95. subucula: an under-garment, made of linen or cotton, worn
beneath the tunic. pexae: lit. “combed”; hence, “with the nap
on,” “ new.’⁷

96. inpar: adjective requiring to be translated by an adverb in
English. See v. 23, n.

99. aestuat: a metaphor from the tide; cp. Eng. “fluctuate”
ordine toto t ablative of respect with disconvenit.

100. mutat quadrata rotundis: a proverbial expression for capricious
changes ς the same meaning would be denoted by mutat quadratis
rotunda, the ablative in each case being instrumental.

101. insanire . . . sollemnia me: “that I suffer from the common
madness.’' Sollemnia comes from sollus, an old word = “whole,”
and amaus, “ year'’; hence it means “things that happen once a
year,” “customary‚'' ‘⁴ religious‚” “ solemn.” The accusative is
cognate ; cp. coronari Olympia, v. 50.

102. curatoris: the praetor could by an injunction (interdicto)
take away property from a madman’s or a prodigal’s control, and
place it and its possessor under the control of some person, usually
selected from the nearest relatives.

103. tutela t the abstract is used for concrete here—“ guardian.'’

104. sis: concessive, “though you are.’' prave sectum . . . ob
unguem: the Romans paid great attention to the trimming of their
nails. The meaning is “though you, Maecenas, are very particular
about small details ot* personal appearance.'’

105. Horace here gives the well-known Stoic paradox that the
ideal wisc man is perfect in evei-ything.

108. praecipue : ‘⁴ beyond all other men.” sanus : the word bears
a double metente: (i) “morally sound,'’ (ii) “physically sound.’⁷
Horace playfully draws out the last sense by the objection, ‘nisse' cum
pituita molestast, “ except when he has a troublesome cold.” pituita:
scanned as a trisyllable—pi·t=1·1’-tc1.
