g 4. Scope of the Epistles. Horace includes the Epistles
as well as the Satires under the general name of sermones
(“Table Talk'’), to distinguish them from his more am-
bitious poetry in the Odes. They are didactic pieces in a
light and lively style, and written from the first with a
view to publication. Some of them have much of the ring
of genuine private letters, such as the letter of introduction
to Claudius Nero (I. iX.) and the chatty note to Julius
Florus (I. iii.); but as a whole they form a collection of
essays on moral and literary topics Each of them is
addressed to some person, one of whose characteristics often
serves as a peg whereon to hang a few remarks about the
art of life chosen from Horace' wide experience. So in
the letters to Fuscus (I. Χ.) and that to his bailiff (I. xiv.)
Horace fixes upon his correspondents’ dislike for the country
and makes it serve as an occasion for a brief essay on dis-
content. In a letter to Lollius (I‘. xviii.) we have a Tuft—
hunter’s vade mecum in miniature. In another to Quintius
(i. xvi.) Horace gives a pleasant description of his rustic
paradise by the banks of the Digentia and then turns off
quite naturally to a discussion on the “truly good man.'’
Vei-y often he takes us into his confidence and unbosoms
the failings that trouble him in spite of all his efforts 3 in
fact it is the strong personality pervading the Epistles
that lends them half their power. ’

The main interest of Book Ι, is persona] and moral-3 that
of Book II. is rather persona] and literary. Horace up->
holds his own literary views with considerable warmth,
crying out against the blind worship of the older Latin
poets simply because they are old, and demanding adherence
to a more rational canon of criticism. He contends that
the Romans ought to endeavour to imitate the perfect
models of Greece and copy their grace and finish rather
than blindly follow the ruggedness of the early Roman
poets then so much in vogue. The last Epistlc forms a
fitting close. It gives us Ilorace' reasons for taking up with
poetry—a kind of Apologyia pro poesi suar—and his reasons
for laying it down betime33 but he cannot refrain from a
little moralising towards the end 3 once more he repeats his
c)·e{l0——“ En joy in moderation ε live aright or die.’‘
