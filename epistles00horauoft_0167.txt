(b) Lucius calpurnius Piso, cons-ul in l 13.c.

On the authority of the scholiast Porphyrion (probably fifth century
A.1).) it was always believed that the Ars I’oecica was dedicated to the
first of the above-mentioned Pisos and his sons. If it was, it must
have been written at the close of Horace’s 1ife; and even so, Piso,
who was only forty at the time of Horace's death (ὅ 13.C.) must have
married young, if he had two sons who were then old enough to
be addressed as iuvenes and to take up litei-ary composition. Moreover
there are several difficulties in assigning so late a date to the Ars
Poenica. One of these is the fact that Aulus Cascellius (sce above),
who is spoken of as if he were alive, would have been between eighty
and ninety at that time, and could not have been practising. Another
is the absence of all reference to Augustus, with whom Horace was in
close touch during his later life. Michaelis, who is followed by
Nettleshsp, would accordingly date the Ars Poetiea about 20 B.c.‚ and
assumes that it was dedicated to the second Piso and his sons. There
is a strong case for the earlier date, but'no reason for supposing that
the epistle was dedicated to the second group of Pisos, except that
they were alive at the time and of a suitable age ; and that the elder
Piso had, like Horace, fought at Philippi and been reconciled to
Augustus. The impression we get of the younger Gnaeus from
Tacitus is certainly not that ot' a man ot* retinement and culture.

Plautus, -i, m.: Titus Maccius Plautus: the greatest of the comio
poets of Rome. He came from Umbria and was probably born about
254 B.c.‚ and published his plays between the First and Second l'unic
Wars. 'l'wenty of his comedies survive, which though Greek in form
are thoroughly Roman in spirit. He was a rapid and original writer,
and Horace, who could see the carelessness of his style, but could not
appreciate his comic gift, criticises him as a rule unfavoumbly.
Plautus died in 184 Rc. (.›1.P. 54. 70).

Pythagoras, ae, m. : (floruit 550-510 lm.) a celebrated philosopher
of Samos. 110 devoted his early years to study and travel, visiting
Egypt and many countries ot' the must for the purpose of nequii-ing
knowledge. Settling down at last in Cioton, he founded a brothox-lwod,
and prcuched his doctrines, the chief of which was int-tempsyebosis,
which Horace ridiculos. He is said to have giu-n great promin‹·nc‹·
to nmnbcr in his theorics, and was creditcd with many mathematical
inventione (11. i. 52).
