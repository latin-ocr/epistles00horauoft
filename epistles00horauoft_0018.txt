affected to despise what to most men are the objects of
ambition‚ while the Cyrenaics‚ whose founder was Aristippus
of Cyrene in Africa (fl. Rc. 370), held that the wise man
will choose no line of action which is not conducive to
pleasure. The easy-going temper of Aristippus evidently
won warni admiration from Horace.

By far the greatest of Socrates' pupils was Plato, an
Athenian (428-347). His most prominent theory was
that of the existence of ‘⁶ ideas,’' εἶθ. general or ideal forms
or archetypes of which, respectively, all created things were
the anti-types or representations3 hence, by extending
Socrates' doctrine that virtue is knowledge, Plato held
that virtue consists in the knowledge of “ideas,⁷' and
demands a contemplative life. From the fact that Plato
taught in a gymnasium named (after the hero Academus)
the Academia, his school of philosophy in called the Academic.
Crantor (fl. B.C. 300), who first wrote commentaries on
Plato’s works, is mentioned by Horace as a typica]
Academician.

Of the great philosopher and scientist Aristotle (b. 385,
d. 322), Horace mentions one famous doctrine, that of
the ‘⁴ golden mean‚'' or the definition of virtue as the mean
between opposite vices.

Next in chronological order among the philosophical
schools referred to in the Epistles is the stom, so called
from the stoa, or portico, in which its founder Zeno taught
at Athens (13.0. 320). Virtue was by the Stoics held to
consist in bringing one's actions into harmony with the
general order of the world. Chrysippus of Soli in Cilicia
(b. 280, d. 206) greatly developed and systematised Stoic
philosophy; while another Stoic mentioned by Horace—
stertinius—is said to have written 220 books on the
subject.

The last school which calls for notice here is the Epicurean,
a school of which Horace professes himself a follower. Its
founder was Epicurus, who began to teach at Athens
B.c. 306. The Epicureans studied physiCS, but only with
the purpose of freeing themselves from superstitious fem-s,
their object being the pursuit of pleasure—-or rather,
repose of mind—which was to be attained by a virtuous life.
