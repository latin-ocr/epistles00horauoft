ᾗ 5. Anusions to Poetry and Philosophy. Horace wrote
for educated readers, and his Epistles teem with litei-ary
allusions. A short account of the several philosophcrs and
poets mentioned will be found in the Notes or in the Index
of Proper Names, a more general survey is given hero for
the sake of those who are unacquainted with the history of
classical literature.

(a) POETRY. The Homerio poems are frequently referred
to by Horace 3 some account of their contents is prefixed to
the Notes on the second Epistle of Book I. N ext in anti-
quity among the poets mentioned eomes Archilochus of Paros
(714-676), who was one of the first writers of what has
been termed ‘⁴ personal ’' poet-ry, as distinguished from epic
narratives and didactic treatises.

Mimnermus of Colophon (fl. 620> made the elegiae couplet
the vehicle of plaintive love-poems; a little later Alcaeus
and Sappho used for the same purpose the stamas· which
are after them named respectively Alcaic and Sapphic.

Pindar (522- 442), the most famous writer of odes of a
public or religious nature, was a native of Thebes in Boeotia 3
his extant works celebrate victories in tho publio games.

After Pindar's time the only Greek poeti-y of iinportance
was dramatio, until we reach the age of the Alexandrian
writers (3rd cent. B.c.). Among these was Callimachus, a
learned and painstakin g writer with little poetic genius, whose
voluminous works enjoyed considerable colchi-ity.

As in Greece, so in Rome, the earlirst poetry (if we except
a few rude hymns to the gods) was epio3 Livius Andronicus
and Naevius in the 3111 century nc. used tho iudigcnous
Saturnian metre for this purpose (Ep. II. i. 158, nutu), but
Ennius (b. 239, d. 169) adopted the Greek hexameter, which
was also used by Lucilius (b. 145, d. 10:3),tl10 first writm
of satire,—the one form of literature which the Romans
originated. These were the writers whom· pomus lim-:tce
