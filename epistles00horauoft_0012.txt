8 INTRODUCTION.

composing Satires, the only field of literature not already
occupied by some contemporary writer. His verses caught
the attention of Vergil and Varius, who introduced him to
Maecenas. The latter was, with Agrippa and Messala, at
once a leading politica] figure and a warm patron of litera-
ture. He introduced Horace to the highest literary society
of the time, including at different dates, besides Varius and
Vergil and many lesser lights, the great names of Tibullus
and Ovid. Propertius too was probably an acquaintance,
but not a friend, of Horace. His patron also presented
Horace to the Emperor Augustus, whom the poet long
treated with respect without affection ; and finally Maecenas
gave him a small estate amongst the Sabine Hills, about
fifteen miles from Tibur. Here and at Rome the poet spent
for the most part the remaining years of his life, dying
on November 27th‚ B.o. 8, a few weeks after Maecenas.

ξ 2. His Writings. In giving his son so liberal an
education the father of Horace must have trusted that he
would one day turn it to good account. Unfortunately,
the death of Caesar and the Subsequent civil war occurred
just at the period when the worth of that education would
under happier circumstances have shown itself3 and, as
we have seen, Horace was driven to the merest drudgery
for a living. His own disgust may have led him to indulge
in the Satires, of which the first book probably appeared

, about B.c. 35. The second book followed in Rc. 30, and in

the same year—the year after Augustus overthrew his
last opponent, Antonius, at Actium—appeared the first of
Horace's lyric compositions, the Epodes. The poet no
longer had any excuse for writing satire, as he was already
able to address Maecenas as amice, and was on the high
road to fortune. The first three books of the Odes appeared
before the end of B.C. 23 3 in B.C. 17 was written the Carmen
Saeculare, an Ode to be sung at the celebration of the Ludi
Saeculares, or Oentennial Games3 and between ΒΩ. 17 and
13 was composed the fourth and last book of the Odos.

The Epistles—letters to various friends in the form of
verse—are in two books: the first was published in 13.c. 203
the date of the second is uncertain : only one thing is clear,
