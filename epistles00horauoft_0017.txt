towns, and dressed the actors in the Greek palliacum in
other plays the soenes were Roman and the actors wore the

and of the latter as toqatae.

(c) PHILOSOPHY. Though the Romans of the first cen-
tury B.c. thought, talked and wrote to a considerable
extent about philosophy, they attained to no originality
in it, but adopted so much as they chose of the existing
Greek systems. To understand Horace' philosophical
allusions, some knowledge is therefore required of the chief
schools of Greek thought.

The earliest philosophers (Tth and 6th cent. nc.)
engaged themselves for the most part in speculations and
theories with regard to the elements of which the universe
is composed and the method of its structure, water, air
and fire being respectively regarded by successive philo-
sophers as the origin of all things. Pythagoras of Samos
(B.c. 580—500), who settled at Crotona in Italy, made
several arithmetica] and geometrical discoveries; the theory,
however, for which he is most famous is his doctrine of
metempsychosis, or the transmigration of the souls of
men and animals. Empedocles of Agrigentum in Sicily
(fl. B.c. 440) regarded the universe as composed of what
are still called “ the four eleinents‚'’ viz. earth, air, fire and
water. Democritus of Abdera in Thrace (ll. ΒΕ. 400) held
that all matter consists of minute atoms of difierent forms,
the nature of the matter varying according to thc conr
binations and positions of the atonis. Democritus was
known as “ the laughing philosopher,’' because he langhed
at the follies ol' mankind.
