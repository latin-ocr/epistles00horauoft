words, aq. addictus iurare, “sentenced to swear” ς fruyes consumere
nati, “ born to devour the fruits ot' the ground’' (Ι. ii. 27); dare
idonens, “fit to give ’' (Ι. xvi. 12) 3 and further instances in I. iii. 35,
Ι. x. 26, ἶ. xvii. 47. This so-called complementary infinitive is not
to be imitated in prose, where we should require ad fruqes consumendas
uati, for fruyes consumere nati.

15. quo ; closely with eumque, “ whithersoever.” This separation
is called Tmesis (“cutting’'). deferor: the regular term to express
“ come to land. '

16. agilis: “a man of action.'' mersor: used reflexively, ‘⁴ I plunge
m self.”

{Z virtutis: objective genitive with eustos and satelles.

20. dies : (lies is often feminine in poetry for metrical reasons,
as here; (lies is nearly always masculine in classica] prose in the
singular, except when it denotes an indefinite period, or the set day
appointed for a transaction, in which cases it is usually feminine.

21. opus debentibus ε = operariis, ‘⁴ labourers,⁷' “ those who are
bound to perform some task.”

22. custodia : “ control '' generally, though not legally, as a woman
could not be a legal guardian (tutor).

23. tarda . . . ingrata: “ slowly and unpleasantlvf’ An adjectival
attribute is often thus used in Latin, where the English idiom usually
requires an adverb or an adverbial phrase. spem consiliumque: =
the fultilment of my hope and the carrying out ot my plan.

24. id : the study of moral philosophy.

26. neglectum: the participle here serves for the protasis of the
conditional sentence, being equivalent to si neqlectmnsfuerit.

27. ut z here explanatory, adevelopment· ot the consecutive use3 the
clause introduced by ut is virtually the subject of restat. elementis
‘⁴ rudiments,'⁷ ‘³ principles.”

28. possis: concessive subjunctive, coming under the use ot* the
subjunctive called jussive. Construe : Non possis ocula contendere
qnantum Lynceus (contendere potnit). Quantum is an accusative of
extent of space used adverbially. Lynceus: one of the Argonauts,
famous for the keenness of his sight.

29. contemnas ε hypothetical subjunctive, taking immqul as accusa·
tive of the direct object; lz't. ‘⁶ do not neglect anointment ’¹ (sce note
on τ. 14). Lippus forms the protasis ot the conditional sentence,
and is equivalent to si lippus sis ; cp. v. 26 ; possis in v. 28 is also
logically a protasis to contemnas.

30. desperes : subjunctive indicating the reason which it is assumed
Maecenas might urge. Glyconis: a celebrated athlete, contemporary
with Horace.

31. nolis: potential subjunctive3 this is really a conditional sub-
junctive, the omitted protasis being easily supplied, or si liceat, “ if
you had the chance.” Prohibere here takes the ablativo of the thing
kept off ; it also takes the accusative of the thing kept off, aq. prohibere
aliquo aliquid, “ to keep something away from some one.’‘

32. est: = licet, “it is possible.'' Quadam goes closely with tenus
