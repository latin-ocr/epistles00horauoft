239. Silenus: the eldest of the satyrs, a somewhat drunken god

ever, credited with divine wisdom‚ and in Vergil, Eeloqne VL, cx-
pounds a theory of the universe.

252. unde etiam trimetris . . . sibi: the subject is izuzzbns, which is
playsully represented as laying down the laws of its own metre. Unde
goes closely with citam, “whence (rue. because of its swiftness) it or-
dained that the name trimeter should attach to iambics, although
each line, etc.’'

253. cum: is concessive, and trimetris, which is predicate to esse and
would naturally be in the accusative, is assimilated, by an idiom com-
mon with verbs of naming, to the case ef z'ambeis.

254. primus . . . sibi: ele. all the feet were the same. non ita
pridem: ‘⁴ not so long since3 ” this cannot be taken very seriously, for
the oldest Greek iambic lines have spondees. Horace presumably
does not mean his sketch to be an account of the historical development
of the iambie line.

256. spondeos: feet consisting of two long syllables; it is now
fashionable to call spondeos in iambie lines “ irrational iambi” and
write them (> —). iura paterna: the iainbie line is regarded as the
inheritcd domain of the iambus.

257. sede: ἐφ’. fect.

258. hic: masculine, not the adverb. Translate “this,’' m. the

iambus, which is also the subject of premit.
