Ithaca (Thrialcz'), a rocky island off the coast of Epirus. He was

varius, -i‚ m. : Lucius Varius Rufus, an epic poet of the first rank

Vergilius, -i, m. (TO-19 B.c.) Publius Vergilius Maro was born at
Andes, near Mantua, in Cisalpine Gaul. After Philippi (42 B.C.) his

restored to him through Pollio’s influence. The first Eologue com-
memorates his gratitudo. His most finished work, tho Georgics,
was undertaken at the suggestion of Maecenas. The Aeneid was
the work of his later years, and was lcft without the finishing
touches he had meant to give it. In his youth he had written the
Culex and some minor poems, and there are still extant ton short
poems, called Bucolies or Ifeloyues, which alone would go far to

support Vergil's claim to the first place among ‘the pocts of Rome
(11.i. 247; A.P. 55).
